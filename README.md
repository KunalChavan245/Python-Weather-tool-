# Python-Weather-tool-

This repository contains a weather data collecting tool created using GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool developed by OpenAI. The tool is designed to collect and display weather data for various locations.

Here we have used python and OpenWeatherApi to get the data of the weather of cities 

Github Copilot helped us to understand and guide us across the code like it literally help predicted the correct code which I was think to write or I can say that even I was struggling to write you can see the screenshots how it helped us to write it
